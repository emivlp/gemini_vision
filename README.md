# **Exploring Multimodal AI with Gemini API: Image and Video Processing**

The Gemini API is a powerful tool for processing images and videos, enabling a wide range of applications for developers. Some of its key vision capabilities include:

* **Generating captions** and answering questions based on images
* **Extracting information from PDFs**, including long documents up to 2 million tokens
* **Describing, segmenting, and analyzing** videos, including both visual and audio data, up to 90 minutes long
* **Detecting objects** in an image and returning bounding box coordinates

This notebook provides a hands-on demonstration of how to leverage the Gemini API for **image and video processing**, including code examples, best practices, and multimodal AI integration.



The Gemini API is a powerful and versatile tool for **multimodal AI**, allowing developers to **process text, images, videos, and documents** seamlessly. 

Throughout this notebook, we have explored various **vision and video capabilities**, demonstrating how Gemini API can **analyze, summarize, and extract insights from multimedia content.**
